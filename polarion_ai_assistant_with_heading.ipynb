The **Plans** topic in Navigation shows the parent-child hierarchy of **Plans** in the current project. You can navigate directly to any **Plan** by clicking on any top-level **Plan**, or expanding it and clicking on the node of any child **Plan**. You can also use the **Search** field in Navigation to search for a specific **Plan**. The Plans page shows a tree table of existing Plans in the current project. The **Name** column shows the hierarchy of the Plans. You can filter the table for a Plan name using the Visual Query Builder in the page toolbar. When the filter finds a Plan, any parent Plans are also shown. You can also filter by the Plan properties listed in the **FAVORITES** column, and/or the Plan fields listed in the **ALL** column of the Visual Query Builder.

The first section is for your **Favorites**. Favorites are personal links to project content that are only accessible when you are working in the project. (This is different from **User Shortcuts**, which are accessible from anywhere you may be working in the portal.) **Favorites** enable you to create quick, easily-accessed links to any project content you need to work with most frequently. If your needs change, you can remove **Favorites** and add new ones to **Navigation**. For example, if you are working on a requirements specification ![Document Icon](#), you can create a **Favorite** that links you to it. If there are some ![Pages Icon](#) Pages you need to refer to while working on the specification, you can create **Favorites** for them as well. Then later, if you switch to working on a test case specification, you can add a **Favorite** for that, optionally removing other **Favorites** if you no longer need them frequently.\\n\\nInitially, the **Favorites** section may be populated with default shortcuts preconfigured in the project template on which your project is based. If you don't need these default shortcuts, you can easily remove them.
